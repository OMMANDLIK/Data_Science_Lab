        "### What is an Expert System?\n",
        "\n",
        "An expert system is a computer program that emulates the decision-making ability of a human expert. It uses a knowledge base of facts and rules to solve problems that would normally require human intelligence. They are often used in areas like diagnostics, financial forecasting, and configuration of complex systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key components of an expert system usually include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Knowledge Base**: Contains facts and rules about a specific domain.\n",
        "2.  **Inference Engine**: Applies the rules to the known facts to deduce new facts or draw conclusions.\n",
        "3.  **User Interface**: Allows interaction with the user (e.g., asking questions, providing recommendations).\n",
        "\n",
        "For a simple decision-making system, we can implement a rule-based expert system where rules are expressed as `IF-THEN` statements."
